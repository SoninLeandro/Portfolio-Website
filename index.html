                <h3>Full-stack developer</h3>
                <p>My name is Leandro Sonin, I'm a graduated student from Codecademy specialized in Full-stack development.<br>
                    I am Argentinian, but have been living in London since August 2021.<br>
                    I've been working on several projects and now I'm ready for my first official job as a developer.<br>            
                </p>
                <p>I used to work in hospitality for most of my life, almost 10 years in the most prestigious hotels and restaurantes from Argentina, Canada, USA and UK.<br>
                I love travelling and getting to know different cultures and traditions, as well as making friends from all over the world!</p>
